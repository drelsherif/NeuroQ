Although DMD typically presents in boys, rare cases in girls can occur due to Turner syndrome, X-inactivation, or translocation. The clinical presentation and very high CK are classic for DMD. SMA doesn't cause calf enlargement or elevated CK. Juvenile dermatomyositis has rash and different pattern. Congenital myasthenia doesn't cause calf enlargement. Genetic testing for dystrophin mutations would confirm the diagnosis.",
